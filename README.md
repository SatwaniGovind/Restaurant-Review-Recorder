# Restaurant-Review-Recorder
Creating a simple web application for recording reviews for restaurants using html, css, javascript(used for login and registration authentication), and bootstrap.

NOTE : Currently, this application has been made only for students of BMS College of Engineering, for easier authentication; however it can be generalized by making the required modification in the scripts.
