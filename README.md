# Restaurant-Review-Recorder
Creating a simple web application for recording reviews for restaurants using html, css, javascript(used for login and registration authentication), and bootstrap.

NOTE1 : The entire project, including all the required files can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xchJadJcJb0XK31o12ey6GfFDVeDBzC4?usp=sharing

NOTE2 : Currently, this application has been made only for students of BMS College of Engineering, for easier authentication; however it can be generalized by making the required modification in the scripts.

NOTE3 : To use the PHP scripts, the scripts will have to be changed by the user. Here, XAMPP has been used.
